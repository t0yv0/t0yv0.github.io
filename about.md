title: About
---

I am an [F#][fsharp] programmer at [Tachyus][tachyus], a start-up
building technology to optimize oil and gas production.

I have 7+ years of F# experience. Before coming to the Bay Area, I was
a key contributor to [WebSharper][ws], the F#-to-JavaScript compiler
and web platform at [IntelliFactory][ify]. I blog and enjoy giving
talks on F#, WebShaper and functional programming. My broader
interests include compiler construction, computer-assisted theorem
proving, data science and statistics.
