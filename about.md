title: About
---


[F#][fsharp] engineer, problem-solving addict, pragmatist.  Most known
for contributions to the [WebSharper][ws] F#-to-JavaScript compiler.

I am a generalist who can contribute across the stack.  I program in a
style influenced by functional programming (Haskell, F#, OCaml, LISP),
but use whatever tools get the job done.  My specific experience is
with F#, .NET and JavaScript platforms, compilers, and UI.  As an Econ
MA, I maintain an interest in applied statistics, and am currently
exploring data science, machine learning and optimization techniques
using SciPy.

At work I am a self-starter.  I value life-work balance, learning
advanced maths, and working with people I can learn from.  Colleagues
remark on the clarity of my writing and technical vision.

I currently work at [Tachyus][tachyus], where we create technology to
optimize energy production for the oil and gas industry.  Before
coming to the Bay Area, I worked on [WebSharper][ws] and other
projects at [IntelliFactory][ify].  I blog and enjoy giving talks on
F#, WebShaper and functional programming.  My broader interests
include compiler construction, computer-assisted theorem proving, data
science and statistics.
