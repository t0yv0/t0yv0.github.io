I have been doing software work for a long time. It never get stale.

Computers and people who wield them continue to fascinate me and broaden my horizons.

These pages are to contain software notes, both work and hobby-related.

My younger self kept a [[https://t0yv0.github.io/about.html][blog]] elsewhere.
