title: Hello Hakyll
---

I am quite pleased [Hakyll](http://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/). In a short
evening I got everything setup pleasantly for writing on a Windows
machine, complete with math and code support:

$$ E = mc^2 $$

Even F# highlighting works out of the box. Nice:

```fsharp
let incr x =
    x + 1
```
